# Git Tutorial

> This article provides a brief overview of how to initialize a project and collaborate on development using Git command line.

> You need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for collaborative development.

## Initialize the Project

1. **Fork the project:**

Open the repository of the project you want to make content modifications to. In this example, we will use CrychicDoc.

Open the [CrychicDoc repository](https://github.com/PickAID/CrychicDoc), click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner to fork the project to your GitHub account.

2. **Initialize the repository:**

Open the command line or terminal or directly execute the following commands in your project folder:

> Github/gitee links of CrychicDoc for cooperation, if you want to provide code for other projects, please refer to the third item.

> [!CAUTION] Caution
> **Please refer to the instructions in the comments to modify the commands, do not copy and paste.**

::: code-group
```bash [git]
# Replace with the actual folder address.
# In this case, enter the folder where you want to store the CrychicDoc code.
cd path/to/your/project
git init # [!code focus]
# In this example, for CrychicDoc, you need to modify the repository code after forking.
# Replace YourUsername with your Github ID, you can directly use the forked repository link.
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUserName/CrychicDoc.git # [!code focus]
git pull origin main # [!code focus]
```

```bash [git]
# Replace with the actual folder address.
# In this case, enter the folder where you want to store the CrychicDoc code.
cd path/to/your/project
git init # [!code focus]
# In this example, for CrychicDoc, you need to modify the repository code after forking.
# Replace YourUsername with your Github ID, you can directly use the forked repository link.
git remote add origin https://gitee.com/YourUsername/CrychicDoc.git # [!code focus]
git pull origin main # [!code focus]
```

```bash [git]
# Replace with the actual folder address.
# In this case, enter the folder where you want to store the CrychicDoc code.
cd path/to/your/project
git init # [!code focus]
# In this example, for CrychicDoc, you need to modify the repository code after forking.
# Replace YourUsername with your Github ID, you can directly use the forked repository link.
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/TheNameOfRepo.git # [!code focus]
git pull origin main # [!code focus]
```

3. **Set up the upstream repository:**

To keep in sync with the original repository, set up the upstream repository:

::: code-group
```bash [git]
git remote add upstream https://github.com/PickAID/CrychicDoc.git
```
:::

4. **Configure Git case sensitivity (IMPORTANT):**

To ensure consistent behavior across all platforms, run the appropriate setup script:

::: code-group
```bash [Linux/macOS/Git Bash]
./.git-setup/setup-git-case-sensitivity.sh
```

```cmd [Windows Command Prompt]
.git-setup\setup-git-case-sensitivity.bat
```

```powershell [Windows PowerShell]
.\.git-setup\setup-git-case-sensitivity.ps1
```
:::

> [!IMPORTANT] Important
> This step is crucial for cross-platform collaboration. It ensures that Git tracks case changes in filenames, preventing conflicts between different operating systems. For more details, see `.git-setup/README.md`.

## Collaboration Workflow

5. **Create and switch to a new branch:**

First, it is recommended to create a new feature branch from the main branch:

::: code-group
```bash [git]
git checkout -b feature-branch
```
:::

6. **Modify the code:**

In your Minecraft instance folder, edit the project's code, resource files, or configuration files and make the necessary modifications and adjustments according to your needs.

7. **Commit the changes:**

After saving the modifications, use the following command to commit the changes to your local repository:

::: code-group
```bash [git]
# Using 'git add .' should generally work fine, but you can replace '.' with the specific file path for added safety.
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your modifications"
```
:::

8. **Push to the remote repository:**

If you are ready to merge your changes into the main branch, push your local branch to the remote repository:

::: code-group
```bash [git]
git push
```
:::

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

9. **Create a Pull Request:**

Open your forked GitHub repository page, select the feature branch you just pushed, click on "Compare & pull request", fill in the relevant information, and submit the PR.

10. **Wait for review and merge:**

It is recommended to inform the developers in advance before submitting.

## Ending Collaboration

11. **Delete local and remote branches:**

Once your PR is merged, you can safely delete the feature branch you created:

::: code-group
```bash [git]
git checkout main
git branch -d feature-branch # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch # Delete remote branch
```

## Guidelines

Every time you perform the above steps, if your repository is behind the original repository, click the "Sync fork" button to synchronize the progress.
